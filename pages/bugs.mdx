## Known bugs

```ansi
root@xmanage:~# xmanage server edit MyServer disklimit
...
The filesystem is already 131072 (1k) blocks long.  Nothing to do!
```
That happens because of the loop devices, which are used for servers. Resizing a filesystem may cause server's files to break, so resize2fs doesn't allow shrinking loop devices. To avoid this, we recommend to reinstall server with the required disk space.
