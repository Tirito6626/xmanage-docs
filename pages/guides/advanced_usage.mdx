 ## Advanced usage
After understanding the configuration you may want to edit it, or?

### Changing basic server details

I do not recommend changing I/O value/CPU/RAM/Swap limit/Port/Startup command manually, because it may conflict with XManage's services file

```ini
 PrivateDevices=true
 ProtectControlGroups=true
 ProtectHome=true
 ProtectKernelTunables=true
 RestrictSUIDSGID=true
 DynamicUser=true
```
These options can be removed/disabled/changed
### Modifying server's configuration
To modify server's configuration, use:
```bash
:~# xmanage server edit-systemd myServer # myServer should be replaced with your server name/ID
```
### Adding additional options
All available options can be found [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html)
